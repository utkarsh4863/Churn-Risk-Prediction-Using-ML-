# 🚀 Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project is a **Flask-based web application** that predicts the likelihood of a customer leaving (or "churning") a business based on their behavior and account information.

The system uses **Machine Learning (ML)** models trained on customer data (such as usage patterns, demographics, and service history) to generate predictions about whether a customer is likely to churn.

It’s designed for businesses that want to:
- Identify at-risk customers before they leave  
- Improve customer retention strategies  
- Make data-driven marketing and customer success decisions  

The project combines **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and a **trained ML model (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest, or Logistic Regression)** integrated with a simple **Flask web interface**.  
Users can input customer details via a form and instantly get the **predicted churn risk** displayed on the web page.

### 🧩 Key Components
- **Machine Learning Model** – Trained to classify customers into “Churn” or “Not Churn” based on historical data  
- **Flask Backend** – Serves the model and handles user input/output  
- **HTML/CSS Frontend** – Simple UI for submitting customer data and viewing results  
- **Preprocessing Pipeline** – Cleans and scales input data before prediction  


---

### 🎯 Objective
To build a lightweight, easy-to-use predictive analytics tool that helps organizations **understand customer behavior** and **minimize churn** by acting proactively on the model’s insights.
